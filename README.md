# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
An introductory course for the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems, with specific emphasis placed on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling paradigm.

## Projects: The Pac-Man
The Pac-Man projects apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. The basic game operating scaffold is provided by the course staff, while the projects themselves teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. 

**Project Overview**

- Project 1: Search
  - Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
- Project 2: Logic
  - Pacman world is represented with booleans, and logical inference is used to solve planning tasks as well as localization, mapping, and SLAM.
- Project 3: Multiagent Search
  - Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
- Project 4: Reinforcement Learning
  - Students implement Value Function, Q learning, and Approximate Q learning to help pacman and crawler agents learn rational policies.
- Project 5: Bayes Nets and HMMs
  - Pacman uses probabilistic inference on Bayes Nets and the forward algorithm and particle sampling in a Hidden Markov Model to find ghosts given noisy readings of distances to them.
- Project 6: Machine Learning
  - Students implement the perceptron algorithm, neural network, and recurrent nn models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification and language identification.
