## Introduction
In this project, students design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, students implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.
## File Directory
- `multiAgents.py`	Where all of your multi-agent search agents will reside.
- `pacman.py`	The main file that runs Pacman games. This file also describes a Pacman GameState type, which you will use extensively in this project.
- `game.py`	The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like AgentState, Agent, Direction, and Grid.
- `util.py`	Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms. You don't need to use these for this project, but may find other functions defined here to be useful.
- `graphicsDisplay.py`	Graphics for Pacman
- `graphicsUtils.py`	Support for Pacman graphics
- `textDisplay.py`	ASCII graphics for Pacman
- `ghostAgents.py`	Agents to control ghosts
- `keyboardAgents.py`	Keyboard interfaces to control Pacman
- `layout.py`	Code for reading layout files and storing their contents
- `autograder.py`	Project autograder
- `testParser.py`	Parses autograder test and solution files
- `testClasses.py`	General autograding test classes
- `test_cases/`	Directory containing the test cases for each question
- `multiagentTestClasses.py`	Project 3 specific autograding test classes
